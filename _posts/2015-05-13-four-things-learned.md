The team at OneRoom has been busy the last few weeks. We’ve been planning, and then running - [our first official class with Hugo House](http://hugohouse.org/store/class/intro-to-fiction-writing-the-short-story-anca-szilagyi/). I’ve also, personally, been busy - because I’m taking the class. ([Remember, I’m not only the Hair Club President - I’m also a client!](https://youtu.be/IuRLGdGnqSU?t=50s)). It’s been fun, and challenging. And I wanted to quickly share a few observations and reflections: 

## Reading your own work out loud really is nerve-wracking.

In the second class session, Anca asked me to read something I had written aloud. (I’m not prepared to share it here - that would be even _more_ nerve-wracking. Maybe something more polished, later. But probably not.) 

I actually really like reading out loud, so I didn’t expect the palpable anxiety - heart beating, and breathing faster. But I think it was useful exactly insofar as it was uncomfortable. I locate the discomfort in the watching as other participants listened, and in being forced to hear my work through _their ears_. (specifically, to hear how boring the paragraphs I had labored over were, vs. how much more interesting the one I had tossed-off quickly without worrying too much…and more importantly, to get a feel for _why_). 

## Amplified swallowing sounds grotesque.

We strongly encourage participants to use headphones with a built-in microphone, to minimize feedback as well as disruption from sirens, construction, loud idling vehicles, etc.

The only problem is, in a two hour workshop, you can get thirsty! With Apple earbuds, the in-line mic winds up about equal distance from your throat as from your mouth. Once amplified, can be just as distracting as a siren - and quite a bit more alarming.

Conclusion: it’s important to mute yourself when drinking and snacking.

## Social commitments are strong motivation.

I’ve had “write a short story” on my to-do list for about 6 months. Terrible to-do list item, for reasons [Wait But Why explains brilliantly](http://waitbutwhy.com/2013/11/how-to-beat-procrastination.html). I think I’m going to come out of this class having done it, and feeling good about it. 

Partly because the class itself is helping to organize that project into smaller, achievable, approachable steps. But I also, crucially, because I know and feel keenly that there are other people expecting me to show up, to be engaged, to be prepared. 

We’ve been pondering this thesis for a while - that online learning as it’s most often practiced tends to fail because there’s no social support, and that live interactions are the solution. Based on this experience, I’m continuing to think it’s really true.   

## Cats!

Another advantage of a live class you can join by video: cats! One student’s cat spent most of the last session perched on his shoulder. Mesmerizing tail action. Cats on the internet! Who knew. 

But I think this also points to something larger. Several of the participants are parents (of humans), and part of the appeal of the online format for them was not having to secure child care. As distinct from live _in-person_ classes, I think we’re going to find that this is significant - easing the burdens of child-care, cat-care, dog-care - not to mention traffic and parking.

I’ll have a lot more to say about this first experience in the next few weeks. For now, signing off, back to work, and looking forward to session 3 tonight.
