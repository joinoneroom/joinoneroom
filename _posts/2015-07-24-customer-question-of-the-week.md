It's been an exciting week at OneRoom. In addition to having the best quarterly meeting I've ever experienced, we're running lots of customer experiments. As with any startup, it's a constant battle to remove risk by testing hypotheses. We have 3 foundational hypotheses: that we can build a synchronous, interactive online learning technology platform, that teachers will want to teach this way, and that there exists a reachable audience of (paying) students for these kinds of experiences. We've made a great deal of progress on the technology and teachers. Now we're turning our attention more squarely to the student and content questions - what do people most want to learn in the uniquely personal online format that OneRoom makes possible?

So this week we started something new, a company-wide (we're only 6 people, but still :) "customer question of the week" where each of us asks 5 people a key question. The idea is inspired in part by Steven Blank. In [4 Steps to the Epiphany](http://www.amazon.com/Four-Steps-Epiphany-Steve-Blank/dp/0989200507), he suggests that everyone - including engineers - spend at least 10% of their time with live customers, face to face. We decided our first question would be: "if you could learn anything, what would you choose?"

I remember hearing Aaron Patzer of Mint.com give a talk about customer development at Founder Institute a few years ago, and mentioning that BART (and public transit in general) is a phenomenal place to do customer research. It's a diverse collection of people, all standing around - a captive, fairly representative sample. Perfect! I set out to ask my 5 questions on my commute. 

When I was a kid I had to sell chocolate candy bars to raise money for my soccer team uniforms. My friend Joe and I walked down the street, intending to go door to door but coming up with one excuse after another why we'd start "at the next house." After walking several blocks, including a few false starts where we literally got to the door of the house then turned around and walked away, I finally rang a doorbell. An older lady opened the door, we made our candy bar "pitch" and to our surprise, she agreed! Walking away $2 richer and feeling quite proud of ourselves, we got in the groove and about an hour later had sold all of our candy bars. Success!

Fast forward 15 years. I'm not even selling anything this time. I'm older, wiser and more confident now, right? This should be a breeze! Nope. Reluctant candy-bar salesman Luke is still with me. I told myself one reason after another why this person I could skip and I'd just ask the next one. I started with big ambitions, thinking I would talk to 25 or 50 people on the BART ride. As always, the hardest was the first, but I made it to 5. The next day I talked to 3 more people. Here are some highlights of what they said: 

Five of the eight people mentioned learning a language. Two focused on practical things - car maintenance, home improvement, cooking - that sort of thing. I heard ambitions to learn a musical instrument (banjo specifically), philosophy, anatomy. One person asked for an "interactive book club".  I asked how it would be different than existing book clubs and if he just meant a small group of people connected virtually rather than in person. He saw value in that, but also liked the idea of a teacher or facilitator leading it. Someone mentioned boxing. Which could be awesome...if potentially hazardous to the equipment.

One idea I find particularly interesting is dancing. A woman I spoke to mentioned she loved to dance, but her boyfriend didn't want to dance in front of other people. She thought that if they could dance together at home and learn from a teacher, he would be much more persuadable. I love this idea, because it's an example of a learning experience that can be accomplished through OneRoom that's otherwise difficult or impossible. 

All-in-all it was a great first experience and I'm excited for our second Customer Question of the Week. The next question will be some version of "What do you want to teach?," since we believe everyone can teach something to someone, and we'd like to open the door for anyone to do so.
