To try to hone in on the absolute best piece of writing advice? Impossible. Thinking on the generosity of teachers can be overwhelming. But here goes, best advice I’ve gotten over and over? That it — all of it — will take forever.

How long is forever? One teacher told me it took him 10 years beyond grad school to place his first story. Via the interview collection Conversations with Andre Dubus (cover photo is an odd choice), I learned to expect years of rejection, and to actually use those years to inure myself to rejection. Dubus said, “I think you should be sending out stories at all times. I started at 18, and I knew I wouldn’t be published but I knew I had to go through a period of rejections…. By the time I got out of college, I had become immune.” And from the teacher who introduced me to that Andre Dubus interview, I learned to expect criticism. Lots and lots of criticism. But to write anyway and believe in what you are doing.

So what did I take from this advice? Knowing to take time, because in writing — with few exceptions — there’s no other way. Publication? Sure, that’s awesome. But even better, to do justice to the piece you’d always hoped to write. And then the next one, and the next. But to get there, according to these writer teachers, plan on around 5–10 years of bad work, another 5–10 years of one-off publications and then, hopefully, a book. And then a more ambitious book in another 5–10. And again, and again, until you check out.

Now, I’m about 8 years in. I’m on track with this ridiculously slow time frame, and I’m mostly okay with it. On days when I don’t get much done, I only hate myself up a little bit. I try not to worry about finding agents and such, because another great teacher advised me that those agents are playing the long game, too.

You can get a primer in an MFA program, but despite the degree title, this writing thing takes a lot longer than a few years to master. This is one reason why I work in creative writing education. I learn from my writing community, people I’ve met through my MFA, my work at Hugo House, and now at OneRoom. In a sense, all of those teachers were telling me that becoming a writer means signing up for a lifetime of study.
