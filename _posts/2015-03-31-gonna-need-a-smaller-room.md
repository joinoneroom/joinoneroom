Greetings! As a first post on the OneRoom blog, I thought I’d share a little of the story of how we got interested in humanizing online learning, and why we think it’s important.

First, a confession: I’ve taken some online classes, and failed at them, repeatedly, and decisively. Like many people, I got excited about MOOCs and enrolled in a bunch of them. Here are some of the classes I’ve abandoned so far:

* [CS50x - Introduction to Computer Science](https://courses.edx.org/courses/HarvardX/CS50x3/2015/info)
* [GG101x - The Science of Happiness](https://courses.edx.org/courses/BerkeleyX/GG101x/1T2014/info)
* [Intro to Computer Science](https://www.udacity.com/course/cs101)
* [Introduction to Corporate Finance](https://www.coursera.org/course/whartonfinance)

I was genuinely interested in these topics. The first three more than the fourth, to be honest.  But really, all of them. And I got some value out of them. But I did not finish them. I bet you have a few vain attempts under your belt, too - most people we've asked do, and of course, that's borne-out in the statistics. Take a look, for example, at [Katy Jordan](http://www.katyjordan.com/)’s fascinating [doctoral thesis research](http://www.katyjordan.com/MOOCproject.html) on the subject. 

Maybe it doesn’t matter. If 100,000 people enroll, and only 500 "finish," you could argue that the other 99,500 were just curious, or got as much as they wanted out of the first few lectures. There’s a library analogy: we don’t say that the library is a failure because people check out books but don’t read every word.

Still, insofar as MOOCs, and recorded video more generally, dominate the landscape of online learning, we think this failure of engagement matters, and points toward a deeper, central flaw. 

Recorded videos are _lectures_. Although many of them offer discussion boards and community-elements of various kinds, they're more-or-less the same at their core: lectures in an online hall with an unlimited number of seats. Lectures aren’t particularly effective in the first place, and they don’t get any better when you remove the social pressure to show up and the opportunity to raise your hand and ask a question. 

There's an obvious answer with a long precedent: we could make the room _smaller_, instead of infinitely large. Lectures aren't the only classroom form. In traditional universities, lectures are often paired with small-group discussion sections. At places like St. John's College, seminars are the _only_ thing. 

Jeff and I resolved to bring the discussion section (or the "seminar," or whatever you might call it) online. But we weren't sure how it would feel. Will people show up? Will it feel as warm, intimate, and connected as we wanted it to?  How do we even do something like this? 

To find out, we conducted some experiments. First, we organized a Google Hangout-based seminar about exobiology and the origin of life. We found a qualified instructor on Craigslist and cajoled some friends into attending. We did 3 sessions. It worked out...ok. But not great. The experience and knowledge of the participants was too widely disparate to sustain a particularly engaging conversation. Also, we weren't sure if students would pay for this kind of thing. Or even show up without the, you know, haranguing. We also had some interesting technology glitches:

So we tried again, with a different teacher and some [Shakespeare enthusiasts from Santa Fe](http://www.meetup.com/SFSCloseReaders/) we found through Meetup.com. We did four sessions close-reading Shakespeare. This time it felt different. There were moments of real engagement that would have been simply impossible without the real-time discussion and live video. We didn't ask anyone to pay up-front, but almost everyone chose to make a voluntary contribution to the teacher at the end. Here's what it looked like:

There was other evidence - [The Minerva Project](https://minerva.kgi.edu/), for instance - was about to start their first semester, all online, all seminar-style. But the key thing for us was seeing that Shakespeare class with our own eyes, and hearing the instructor's response - 

> This is making me want to teach online...I’m convinced that one can actually create a usable learning environment with the right technology.

We felt for the first time that live video could achieve this feeling of togetherness. Even if it's not quite the same as being in a same physical room together, and won’t be for some time (not, at least, until we have fully immersive brain-implant-based virtual reality - so, 2019). 

Building a platform around small, live synchronous classes is, we’ll (proudly) admit, kind of contrarian. It's deliberately small-scale. To record a class once, then sell it a bajillion times is unquestionably appealing from a business standpoint. The problem is, for learning, it just doesn't work very well. When you focus on scale exclusively, you lose what's arguably the most important: the humanity. (And not incidentally, also, The Humanities!)   

So we're giving this a shot. And for the record, we think that being human-scaled can be great for learning, and great for business, too. We're going to prove it.
