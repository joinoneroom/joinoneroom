## Your fiction career is successful—among other recognitions, you were anthologized in The Anchor Book of New American Short Stories—and you seem to love the short story form. What made you decide to write a memoir? When did you come to the idea?

*I've called The Secret Life of Objects my accidental memoir. I was drinking coffee out of the mug I always take from my cupboard, even though I have a dozen others, because this mug came from my mother's house and for me it contains a whole story about my mother and my aunt. Then I realized my house is full of things like this—objects you wouldn't give me five bucks for but that are priceless to me. I started writing them down very quickly—really, just for my kids because I wanted them to have a record. Once it was all written down, I realized that together these objects told the story of a family. Generally speaking, I die a thousand deaths over every book but this one came fast, perhaps because I had no expectations at the outset.*
 
## What can you tell us about your next book, The Strange Case of Dr. Couney?

*This one is a biography. I had thought I was researching a novel when I stumbled across a true story so compelling that I just had to tell it, and the facts were so astonishing to me that I wanted to do it as nonfiction. I do think the story dictates from. This book is kicking my butt, by the way.*
 
## Tell us a bit about how your work as an editor has influenced your writing and teaching.

*Working as an editor has immeasurably enriched me as a writer and teacher. In my workshops, I always stress that the more care you take in editing your classmates, the more you'll learn that will apply to your own writing. Often it's easier to see and correct a problem in another writer's work, or—at least as important—to identify an opportunity. The more you use those skills, the more ingrained they become, and they're transferable. To be sure, you'll never be objective about your own writing, but you'll have better tools.*
 
## You’ve taught in many different environments—all over the world with the Summer Literary Seminars, at the Center for Fiction in New York, at Columbia University—what do you find is different about each teaching experience?

*Every experience is different, in part because of the individuals in the class and in part because of the setting. The international seminars are terrific because everyone is a stranger in a strange land, which forces you to look with a fresh eye and challenge assumptions. My MFA students were very focused at the start of their careers, while my wonderful students at the Center for Fiction were all ages and from many different backgrounds, which made for a rich experience for everyone. I keep in touch with many of my students.*
 
## And finally, what interests you about teaching online, specifically through OneRoom? 

*I love the idea that OneRoom isn't bound by geography but it's in real-time, so we can have true connection! Whether you're in New York with a million other choices or in a remote area with nary a workshop in sight, being able to work with people in other parts of the country is refreshing, and a chance to gain new perspectives.*
