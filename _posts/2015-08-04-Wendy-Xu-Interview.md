We asked five questions of poet and teacher [Wendy Xu](http://extrahumanarchitecture.tumblr.com/). She told us about the struggles of believing in your own work and her excitement of an online classroom with face-to-face capabilities and easy communication tools.

___

## Why do you choose to teach this subject?

*I've always been interested in place-based languages having left one home (Shandong, China), one language, at an early age for another. I think for immigrants the idea of "native language" is incredibly fraught, but in some regards may also be fruitful. Or, healing. I want the poem to be a site for resistance, and want to work through these possibilities with others.*

## How did you end up placing your book with CSU Poetry Center?

*I entered CSU's annual first-book contest in 2012, and was lucky enough to be the runner-up that Michael Dumanis picked for publication. I'd been reading (I still read) CSU Poetry Center books for a long time--it was a happy, lucky thing for me.*

## You are the recipient of some fairly prestigious and competitive prizes. What was the path like leading up to those prizes?

*It's always a matter of convincing myself that I've said (written) something meaningful, something worth saying and writing for myself and potentially others, and then hoping that my work will be read with care on the other end. The Ruth Lilly saved my life in a lot of ways, and the path leading up to last September included sending up a lot of prayers to Chinese deities, GuanYin, my ancestors.*

## And finally, what interests you about teaching online, specifically through OneRoom? 

*When I was in grad school, each semester a few people would get appointed to teach a section of creative writing or poetry online. And the conversation surrounding that appointment was a matter of how to maximize all the good of the internet (flexibility, increased democracy of access) with the challenges (awkward interfaces, no in-person contact). I've been interested in it ever since then, but have felt genuinely intimidated by trying to customize existing platforms (Skype, Google Hangout, etc) to suit creative writing. Like, how to collect and disseminate student work? How to replicate group work, or, everyone's favorite part of a vigorous yet draining session, the break? How to tailor my own pedagogy to an online platform?*

*These are questions I want to answer because I like the idea that online learning removes the hierarchy of location—what if the town you live in doesn't offer a million classes through local organizations? What if it's difficult to arrange reliable transportation to take a class, or attend school, and public options aren't so great? What if childcare is an issue for you? I think the work-around to at least some of this is here.*
