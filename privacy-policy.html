      <p>
        <strong>6. Sharing your personal information. </strong>We do not sell or rent your personal information to third parties for marketing purposes unless you have granted us permission to do so.</p>
      <p>We may share your personal information within OneRoom and its affiliated companies and with third party service providers for purposes of data processing or storage.</p>
      <p>We may also share your personal information with business partners, service vendors, authorized third-party agents or contractors in order to provide a requested product or transaction, including processing orders, processing credit card transactions,
        hosting websites, hosting event and seminar registration and providing customer support. We only provide these third parties with the minimum amount of personal information necessary to complete/utilize the requested product or transaction, and

      <p>While navigating OneRoom’s website or products you may be directed to content or functionality that is hosted by a third-party supplier. When information is collected on behalf of OneRoom exclusively, OneRoom’s privacy policy will be referenced
        and will govern how your information is used. For other, non-OneRoom sites or services, the site/service owner's privacy policy will be referenced. You should review such supplier's privacy and security policies prior to use.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>7. Security of your personal information. </strong>OneRoom is committed to protecting the personal information you share with us. We utilize a combination of industry-standard security technologies, procedures, and organizational measures to help
        protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure.</p>
      <p>When we transfer credit card information over the Internet, we protect it using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption technology.</p>
      <p>We recommend you to take every precaution in protecting your personal information when you are on the Internet. For example, change your passwords often, use a combination of letters and numbers when creating passwords, and make sure you use a secure
        browser.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>8. Cookies. </strong>Like many websites, OneRoom uses technologies, such as cookies and web beacons, which allow us to make your visit to our website easier, more efficient and more valuable by providing you with a customized experience and recognizing
        you when you return.</p>
      <p>A cookie cannot read personal data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites; indeed, the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. Accepting the cookies used on our website may give
        us access to information about your browsing behavior, which we may use to personalize your experience and track user traffic patterns, and to merge this info when you register. We do this in order to determine the usefulness of our website information
        to our users and to see how effective our navigational structure is in helping users reach that information. You may browse most of OneRoom’s website without accepting cookies from OneRoom; however, some website functionality may be lost by disabling
        cookies on your computer. Other OneRoom web pages, particularly those which require a login and password, require cookies and cannot be used when you have disabled cookies in your browser.</p>
      <p>In addition, OneRoom uses web beacons in conjunction with cookies to understand user behavior. Web beacons are simply a convenient way of gathering basic statistics and managing cookies, and do not give away any extra information from your computer.
        Turning off your browser's cookies will prevent web beacons from tracking your specific activity.</p>
      <p>If you prefer not to receive cookies while browsing our website or via HTML-formatted emails, you can set your browser to warn you before it accepts cookies or refuse the cookie when your browser alerts you to its presence. You can also refuse all
        cookies by turning them off in your browser. You may browse most of the OneRoom Website without accepting cookies; however, some website functionality may be lost by disabling cookies on your computer. Other OneRoom web pages, particularly those
        which require a login and password, require cookies and cannot be used when you have disabled cookies in your browser. For additional information about cookies and other tracking technologies, including instructions for blocking their use, see
        <a class="link" href="http://privacy.getnetwise.org/browsing/tools">http://privacy.getnetwise.org/browsing/tools</a>.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>9. Linked websites and third party services.</strong> Our Website and services may provide links to other third-party websites and services which are outside our control and not covered by this policy. We encourage you to review the privacy policies
        posted on these (and all) sites you visit or services you use.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>10. Newsgroups/Forums.</strong>If you participate in a OneRoom course, room, or other interactive interface, you should be aware that the information you provide there will be made broadly available to others, potentially inside or outside OneRoom,
        who have access to that discussion forum. Also, please recognize that individual course and rooms may have additional rules and conditions. Each participant's opinion in a course or room is his or her own and should not be considered as reflecting
        the opinion of OneRoom.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>11. Children's privacy.</strong> OneRoom does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If we learn that we have collected personal information on a child under the age of 13, we will delete that data from our
        systems. OneRoom encourages parents and guardians to go online with their children. Here are a few tips to help make a child's online experience safer:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Teach children never to give personal information (such as name, address, phone number, school, etc.) unless supervised by a parent or responsible adult.</li>
        <li>Know the sites your children are visiting and which sites are appropriate.</li>
        <li>Look for website privacy policies. Know how your child's information is treated.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Please visit the FTC's website for more tips on protecting children's privacy online.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>12. Consent to transfer, processing and storage of personal information. </strong>We may transfer your personal information to the United States, to any OneRoom affiliate worldwide, or to third parties acting on our behalf for the purposes of
        processing or storage, and by providing any personal information you fully understand and unambiguously consent to such transfer, processing and storage of such information.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>13. Questions or comments? </strong>Should you have any privacy-related questions or comments related to this privacy policy, please send an email to <a class="link" href="mailto:privacy@joinoneroom.com">privacy@joinoneroom.com</a>.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>14. Policy updates. </strong>OneRoom may amend this privacy statement from time to time, and at any time. We will post a notice whenever this privacy statement is materially changed. Your continued use of the OneRoom Website or products after
        any change will signify and confirm your assent to those changes.</p>
