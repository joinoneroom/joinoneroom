<p class="f3"><strong>What browser should I use?</strong>
</p>

<p class="f3"><strong>How do I mute myself?</strong>
</p>

</p>
<p class="f4">You'll find the mute button in the gray bar located above the videos in your live class. The mute button looks like a mini microphone icon, and appears light gray when deactivated.
