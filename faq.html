</p></center>

<p class="f4">Muting is a useful tool if you’re in a noisy place, or are sick and plagued with constant coughing!
</p>
<p class="f4">You'll find the mute button in the gray bar located above the videos in your live class. The mute button looks like a mini microphone icon, and appears light gray when deactivated.

When you click the button and mute yourself, you will see the microphone button turn black and a red microphone icon will appear in the top right corner of your video box.

And, to un-mute yourself, simply click the black microphone button again!

<center><p class="f4"><strong>How do I turn my video off? </strong>
</p></center>

<p class="f4">To turn your own video feed off, click the light grey button (that looks like a camera), located above the live videos. When you turn your video feed off no one will be able to see you and your video box will look like this:

To turn your video back on, just click the camera button (now black) again.

</p></center>

<p class="f4"><ul>
	<li>When in a live video class, it’s best to use headphones with a mic. This will help others hear you more clearly and cut down on excess background noise (you’ll hear others better too!).</li>
	<br>
	<li>Close other programs and tabs on your computer. The less your computer has to manage, the better! Sometimes having too many things running on your computer can decrease your video and audio quality. </li>
</ul>
