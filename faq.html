<center><p class="f3"><strong>What browser should I use?</strong>
</p></center>

<p class="f4">Right now OneRoom only runs on Google Chrome. We don’t (yet) run on other browsers or devices other than computers. </p>
<p class="f4">If you don't already have Google Chrome on your computer, <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/" target="_blank">download it here!</a>
</p>

<p class="f3"><strong>How do I mute myself?</strong>
</p>

<p class="f4">Muting is a useful tool if you’re in a noisy place, or are sick and plagued with constant coughing!
</p>
<p class="f4">You'll find the mute button in the gray bar located above the videos in your live class. The mute button looks like a mini microphone icon, and appears light gray when deactivated.

When you click the button and mute yourself, you will see the microphone button turn black and a red microphone icon will appear in the top right corner of your video box.

And, to un-mute yourself, simply click the black microphone button again!  
</p>

<p class="f3"><strong>How do I turn my video off? </strong>
</p>

<p class="f4">To turn your own video feed off, click the light grey button (that looks like a camera), located above the live videos. When you turn your video feed off no one will be able to see you and your video box will look like this:

To turn your video back on, just click the camera button (now black) again.
