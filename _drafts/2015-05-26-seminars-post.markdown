Technology is increasingly changing the landscape of education. We read textbooks on screens, take notes on laptops, there’s [an ever growing list of startups doing classroom gamification](https://www.crunchbase.com/category/gamification/af922a55ff56771ab9b506c1284ef0c8), not to mention the burgeoning phenomenon known as [edtech](http://edtechreview.in/dictionary/119-what-is-edtech). The air is heavy with “disruption”.

At OneRoom, we’re deeply interested in the how and why (and what) of educational progress - especially in how it intersects with technology (hence, edtech!). So, naturally, we have been thinking about the roots of our modern disruption. Asking, what has made edtech evolve this way? And, what is the underlying drive, the philosophical undercurrent of these disruptions? After some thinking and reading we were eventually lead back to a guy name John Dewey, and some ideas he had about education 70 years ago. 

Dewey was interested in the role of pedagogical structure in education. In the first structure that Dewey called “traditional education,” there are strict student and teacher roles. Teachers are placed at the top of the hierarchy of authority, passing down bits of knowledge to students. This model of learning treats knowledge as definable, quantifiable, and stagnant. 

Then, on the other hand, what Dewey calls “progressive education”. A structure where students’ voices are the main event of the learning process. Instead of a monologue, there’s a communal sharing of ideas. Student participation and engagement are central, and each student is encouraged to bring their own experience and perspective to the table. Since experience plays a big part in what and how people learn, knowledge itself is treated as fluid and evolving.

In some ways we never entirely completed the shift to the progressive model of education - the traditional style still persists. But in general, progressive principles are widely taught and practiced - and we think that’s a step in the right direction. 

So how would we place all the recent innovation in this context? How does “edtech” play in to this? One clear example is MOOCs - Massive Open Online Courses - [which took the world by storm in 2011](http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/30/a-history-of-moocs-open-online-courses/?_r=0). They have significant advantages for accessibility and affordability. But, centered around pre-recorded lectures, with assigned reading and homework exercises, and online discussion forums, they don’t sit well with progressive ideals. In some ways, they replace “sages on stages” with “sages on screens.” There’s a loss of personal connection. Much of the work is done alone, and students often find themselves feeling isolated and lonely.

As Dewey recognized, most of us learn best when we feel some kind of kinship and collaboration with our peers. We develop these things through body language, facial expressions, tone of voice, and the general organic connections made by real-time conversations. These things often don’t come through in an online forum.

And, on the opposite side of the technological spectrum, there are brick and mortar institutions like [St. John’s College](http://www.sjc.edu/). St John’s embraces the progressive spirit (even if the curriculum, revolving around the “Great Books,” is in another sense deeply conservative). The entire curriculum is seminar-based. They don’t employ the traditional roles of “teacher” or “professor.” Instead, they designate “tutors” who lead these seminars and are there to pose questions and facilitate inquiry.

As for us, we’re left wondering what could happen if there were real-time, online spaces that solved the problems of accessibility, human connection, and student engagement. A disruption that brings Dewey into the world of edtech - or, more importantly, a disruption that can marry the reach of the internet with the intimacy and humanity of the seminar.
