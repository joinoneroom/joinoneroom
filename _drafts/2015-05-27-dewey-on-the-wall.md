Technology is transforming the landscape of education. We're flipping classrooms and going to bootcamps. We’re reading textbooks on tablets and taking notes on laptops. There’s disruption afoot.

At OneRoom, we’re deeply interested in the how and why (and what) of educational progress, and how it intersects with technology. So we’ve been thinking about the roots of this modern disruption. Asking, what are the philosophical undercurrents of these disruptions? Specifically, we’ve been thinking about John Dewey, and the ideas he had about education 70 years ago.

Dewey distinguished between to two main educational models. In the structure he called “traditional education,” there are strict student and teacher roles. Teachers sit at the top of a hierarchy of authority, passing down bits of knowledge to students. This model of learning treats knowledge as definable, quantifiable, and stagnant. By contrast, “progressive education” emphasizes students’ voices as central to the learning process. Instead of a monologue, there’s a communal sharing of ideas. Students participate and engage, and each student is encouraged to bring their own experience and perspective to the table. Knowledge itself is treated as fluid and evolving. These progressive principles are widely espoused today - and we think that’s to the good.

So how does all the recent innovation and disruption fit in this picture? Let’s look at MOOCs - Massive Open Online Courses. When they [took the world by storm in 2011](http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/30/a-history-of-moocs-open-online-courses/), they seemed to offer significant advantages for accessibility and affordability. But, centered around pre-recorded lectures, with assigned reading and homework exercises, and online discussion forums, they don’t mesh particularly well with progressive ideals. In some ways, they replace “sages on stages” with “sages on screens.” There’s a loss of personal connection. Much of the work is done alone, and students often find themselves feeling isolated.

As Dewey recognized, most of us learn best when we feel some kind of kinship and collaboration with our peers. We develop these things through body language, facial expressions, tone of voice, and the general organic connections made by real-time conversations. These things often don’t come through in an online forum.

That’s why, at OneRoom, we’re focusing on real-time, live online learning. We’re trying to preserve human connection and stimulate deep student engagement, and to foster the kind of  disruption that remembers and embraces Dewey’s insights. 

So! Today, we’d like call on education innovators to join us in putting Dewey’s books on the shelf and his portrait on the wall:
