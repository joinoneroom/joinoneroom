When we started talking about what it would mean to humanize online learning, we struggled with the scope of that challenge. It felt compelling and important, but it also seemed dauntingly…vague. 

As enthusiasts for the ideas of the [Lean Startup](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_startup) movement, our greatest fear was building something that no one would use. We’re convinced that it’s possible to build a product-centered “horizontal” business - solving a common problem across many disciplines - but we also felt the need to have a clear picture of who this was _for_. 

So what did we do? We “got out of the building,” as they say.  

Actually we mostly stayed in the building, because it would be unseemly for people who are insisting that live video interactions can have the same richness as in-person ones to insist on in-person meetings. So we did a lot of videoconferences. First on Google Hangouts, then more recently on OneRoom. 

Of the many possible foci, there were a few leading contenders. We talked to a test-prep company in Plano, Texas. We talked to a half dozen “coaches” (professional and personal) of various stripes. We considered group therapy (our conception of “online learning” is broad - it’s not limited to what’s typically thought of as “education”). Also home-schooled kids, music teaching, facilitating study-groups for MOOCs, and I’m sure more that I haven’t mentioned yet. Oh - right - group Torah/Talmud study. We don’t permanently rule any of these out. In fact, we remain excited about a lot of them. And if you’re reading this and thinking “oh, OneRoom would be awesome for _x_,” [drop me a line](mailto:scott@joinoneroom.com) - I’d love to talk. 

But we did find one particular “vertical” where our proposal really resonated, and that was with writing teachers. This was largely inspired by a conversation with a friend, Suzanne (Suzie) Mozes, who started an independent writing academy of sorts called [Storybuilding](http://www.storybuildingseries.com/) in 2014. 

I had never actually participated in a writing workshop. It might have been good for me - I spent a little time in my early twenties trying to write poetry and short stories, and couldn’t [forgive myself the horrors of the first draft](https://twitter.com/alaindebotton/status/576491381406986240), and Ira Glass hadn’t yet [given beginners permission to suck for a while](http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/309485-nobody-tells-this-to-people-who-are-beginners-i-wish). 

But writing workshops have been in my peripheral vision for a while. Some close friends from college participated in many, other friends (hi Katy) earned MFAs and write memoirs and poetry. I remember their descriptions of workshops - the severity and vulnerability of being silent while others critique your work, and thinking “that sounds intense.”

So I kind of knew how this normally worked - maybe some lecturing, often some assigned reading, but mostly centered around writing and reacting to other students’ writing. A couple of things Suzie told me in that first conversation that really resonated: 

* She started organizing writing workshops a long time ago, and one of them is still going many years later.
* Storybuilding emerged out of former students actively seeking her out, and saying “please do this."
* The students sounded amazing. Most of them had been told at some point in their lives that they have a “gift with words,” and were trying to see what that meant for them.

Suzie connected me to a few other teachers, who connected me to a few others still, and in the course of talking to them, we learned a lot about different teaching practices and heard many more stories of deeply satisfying workshop experiences. And the prospect of having an online classroom that’s really *made* for writing workshops was exciting to these teachers. More about what that means in a future post.  

As we thought more about it, it came to seem more and more like the right thing. The writing workshop has something in common with group therapy, and the asynchronous version that’s common, where everything happens by exchange of text - can’t possibly accomplish the same feeling of intimacy. Storytelling is a crucial professional skill. [Writing is therapeutic](http://well.blogs.nytimes.com//2015/01/19/writing-your-way-to-happiness/). And most broadly, it speaks to the upper reaches of Maslow’s hierarchy in a way we feel is important. 

There’s plenty of opportunity for caricature and satire in this. One of my favorite New Yorker cartoons: 

[![New York is memoir country](/img/blog/memoir-country.png)](http://www.condenaststore.com/-sp/New-York-is-Memoir-Country-New-Yorker-Cartoon-Prints_i8544107_.htm)

I also recently followed and am consistently amused by [@guyinyourMFA](https://twitter.com/guyinyourmfa).

Still, there’s something real and significant about the need to express ourselves in written words. It transcends the much-discussed demise of the publishing industry. Writing is important, it’s also _hard_ and _lonely_, and difficult to keep at it. That’s why people seek out workshops. 

There’s a passage from a Richard Hugo essay called “In Defense of Creative-Writing Classes” that our friends at the (wonderful) [Hugo House](http://hugohouse.org/) in Seattle shared with me: 

> It is possible for a good teacher to get from [a] student one poem or one story that far exceeds whatever hopes the student had. It may be of no importance to the world of high culture, but it may be very important to the student. It is a small thing, but it is also small and wrong to forget or ignore lives that can use a single microscopic moment of personal triumph. 

That sums it up, in my book.
