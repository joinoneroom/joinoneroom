A confession: I failed miserably in my attempts to learn stuff in online classes. Like many people, I got excited about MOOCs and enrolled in a bunch of them. Here are the classes I’ve abandoned so far:

* Harvard CS50x
* Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (not a MOOC exactly - but the lectures are available and they run closely parallel to the textbook, and the 1970’s polyester Abelson and Sussman are wearing is amazing)
* Introduction to the Principles of accounting
* [to-do: remember all the rest]

I was genuinely interested in these topics. The first two more than the third, to be honest...but really, all of them. And I got real value out of them. But I did not finish them. I bet you have a few vain attempts under your belt, too - most people we've asked do, and of course, that's borne-out in the statistics: [cite something]. 

There are also those who claim it doesn't matter. If 100,000 people enroll, and only 500 "finish," does it matter? Maybe the other 990,000 were just curious, or got as much as they wanted out of the first few lectures. There’s a library book analogy. We don’t say that the library is a failure because people check out books but don’t read every word. 

I think those responses are too facile. The flaw is more fundamental: MOOCs, at heart, are lectures in a hall with an unlimited number of seats. And lectures have never been particularly effective in the first place. The good ones, at least, allow you to raise your hand. The best ones, like Michael Sandel's _Justice_, are tremendously engaging, even with an audience of hundreds. 

But mostly, they're pretty uninspiring and demonstrably ineffectual. [links to lecturing being ineffective and to active lecturing research here]. Although many of them offer discussion boards and community-elements of various kinds, they're more-or-less the same at their core: lectures online in a globe-sized lecture hall. 

# What if we try a smaller room?

There's an obvious answer with a long precedent. Lectures aren't the only classroom form. In traditional universities, lectures are often paired with a small-group discussion section. At places like St. John's College, seminars are the _only_ thing. 

Jeff and I resolved to bring the discussion section (or the "seminar," or whatever you might call it) online. But we weren't sure how it would feel. Will  people show up? Will it feel as warm, intimate, and connected as we wanted it to?  How do we even do something like this? 

So, we did some experiments. First, we organized a Google Hangout-based seminar about exobiology and the origin of life. We found a qualified instructor on Craigslist and inveigled some friends into attending. We did 3 sessions. It worked out...ok. But not great. The experience and knowledge of the participants was too widely disparate to sustain a particularly engaging conversation. Also, we weren't sure if students would pay for this kind of thing. Or even show up without the, you know, haranguing. 

So we tried again, with a different teacher and some Shakespeare enthusiasts from Santa Fe we found through Meetup.com. We did four sessions close-reading Shakespeare. This time it felt different. There were moments of real engagement that would have been simply impossible without the real-time discussion and live video. We didn't ask anyone to pay up-front, but almost everyone chose to make a voluntary contribution to the teacher at the end.  

There was other evidence - The Minerva Project, for instance - was about to start their first semester. But seeing this class with our own eyes, and hearing the instructors response - "I'm convinced it's...] - we felt for the first time that live video could achieve this feeling of togetherness - even if it's not quite the same as being in the same physical room together (and won’t be for some time - at least until there’s fully immersive brain-implant-based virtual reality. So, not until 2019). 

Google Hangouts, on the other hand...not ideal. We'll have more to say on that in future posts. 

# Being contrarian

Building a platform around small, live synchronous classes is in some ways profoundly contrarian. It's deliberately, purposefully, and stubbornly un-scalable. To record a class once, then sell it a bajillion times is unquestionably appealing from a business standpoint. The problem is, for learning, that just doesn't work very well. Learning isn't like this.

When you focus on scale exclusively, you lose what's arguably the most important: the humanity. (And not incidentally, also, The Humanities!)   

So we're giving this a shot. And for the record, we happen to think there are not just sustainable, but indeed highly attractive, businesses that can be built in the education world with humanity at the center. We're going to prove it.
