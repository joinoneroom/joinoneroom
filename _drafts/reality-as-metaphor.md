title: Reality is our metaphor

At OneRoom, we're building a live video online classroom. And we're trying to make it feel _good_ to be "in" that classroom. 

We think that feeling good requires feeling comfortable, and that feeling comfortable requires that the laws of the universe be observed. 

So we like to remind ourselves: "Reality is our metaphor."

We don't mean this in a mystical sense. Also not in the skeuomorphic sense of felt backgrounds and simulated aluminum. We mean something a bit more conceptual. 

Here are some things that don't usually happen in the real world, at least without chemical intervention: 

* Heads magically grow in size by a factor of 5
* People don't appear in two places at once
* People don't simply vanish
* If I'm talking, your lips aren't sealed shut

Reality also presents choices: if we're building a room, do we want the door to be opaque, transparent, or translucent? Which would you feel more comfortable entering?:
